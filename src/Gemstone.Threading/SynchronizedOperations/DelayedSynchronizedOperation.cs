/// Represents a short-running synchronized operation that cannot run while it is already

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// By default, the action performed by the <see cref="DelayedSynchronizedOperation"/>
/// is executed on the <see cref="ThreadPool"/> when running the operation asynchronously.
/// When the operation is set to pending, the action is executed in an asynchronous loop on
/// the thread pool until all pending operations have been completed. Since the action is
/// executed on the thread pool, it is best if it can be executed quickly, without
/// blocking the thread or putting it to sleep. If completion of the operation is
/// critical, such as when saving data to a file, this type of operation should not
/// be used since thread pool threads are background threads and will not prevent the
/// program from ending before the operation is complete.
