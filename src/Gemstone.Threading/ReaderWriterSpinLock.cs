//  03/21/2011 - J. Ritchie Carroll
//       Generated original version of source code based on Joe Duffy's Weblog articles.
//  03/21/2014 - Steven E. Chisholm
//       Removed the processor fanning that occurred in the readers since the overhead associated
//       with the reduced contention slowed down the class and each instance of this class consumed
//       a substantial amount of memory.

/// Represents a fast, lightweight reader/writer lock that uses spinning to perform locking. No recursive acquires or
/// upgradable locks are allowed (i.e., all entered locks must be exited before entering another lock).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This reader/writer lock uses <see cref="SpinWait"/> to spin the CPU instead of engaging event based locking. As a result it
/// should only be used in cases where lock times are expected to be very small, reads are very frequent and writes are rare.
/// If hold times for write locks can be lengthy, it will be better to use <see cref="ReaderWriterLockSlim"/> instead to avoid
/// unnecessary CPU utilization due to spinning incurred by waiting reads.
