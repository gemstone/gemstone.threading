## Remarks

When the operation is marked as pending, it will run again after the operation that is currently running has completed. This is useful if an update has invalidated the operation that is currently running and will therefore need to be run again.

This method does not guarantee that control will be returned to the thread that called it. If other threads continuously mark the operation as pending, this thread will continue to run the operation indefinitely.
